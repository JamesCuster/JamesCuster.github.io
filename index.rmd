I am a lifelong Texan, which is a source of pride and shame depending on the day. I am currently in the final semester of my MS in Biostatistics at The University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, Texas. Hoping to return to Austin this summer. My current research is focused on HPV infections in the general adult population of the United States under the supervision of Dr. Stacia DeSantis and Dr. George Delclos. Previously I worked on the School Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey at the Michael and Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living which established a childhood obesity surveillance system to monitor the prevalence of overweight/obesity in school-aged children in Texas.

I am an R enthusiast and find great enjoyment in demystifying data. I loved jigsaw puzzles as a kid (still do), and figuring out data is my adult jigsaw puzzle.
