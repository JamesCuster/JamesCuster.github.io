When I first discovered that it was possible to create a website using R Markdown's built in site generator, I had not yet heard of blogdown. Using this great tutorial from <a href="https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html">Emily C. Zabor</a> and the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown">R Markdown: The Definitive Guide></a> by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund, I set out on a seemingly ambitious effort to create my own personal website; this is something that I would never have envisioned myself doing. I do not have a background in software development at all, and most of my coding experience has surrounded statistical programming and machine learning in R and Python. Thanks to the great resources mentioned above it was a relatively simple task getting a website up and running. Soon I was starting to add some customization and using more elements of the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/sandstone">Bootswatch Sandstone</a> theme,  admittedly with much help from my wonderful fianc&eacute; who is a software developer. Thanks, babe!

Unfortunately, after a lot of work (for me at least) I started to realize that I was going to have some real issues with the flat directory that the basic R Markdown site generator assumes. I found some hacky ways to get around this feature, such as including new YAML files in sub-directories, but this was not a very good solution. Additionally, I knew that I was going to want to add this blog to the site, but I really liked the design of the website I had created and I didn't want to just throw my work away and start anew. Thus this post. I started searching for ways to to convert my website from the simple R Markdown site to a blogdown website, but I found the resources for such a task wanting. So I set out with a little guidance and this blog post will chronicle that journey. 

Full disclaimer!! I am still by no means a software developer. I am not claiming that this is the correct way, or even a good way to go about this. This is just what I did in order to convert my website from R Markdown to blogdown while still using the Sandstone Bootswatch theme, and it is working fine for me thus far. This <a href="http://whipperstacker.com/2016/09/22/convert-an-existing-site-into-hugo/">blog post</a> was a great starting point for me as it heplped me to understand the inner workings of a Hugo theme a little better. However, it did not allow me to manage the website from the config.toml file how I wanted to. 

First things first, I created a new Rstudio project and selected the blogdown website option. I accepted the default settings which will provide you with a pre-built website using hugo-lithium theme which I used to serve as the bones for my site. Next I renamed the hugo-lithium file under the themes directory to sandstone and changed this setting in the config file as well. 


# Add sandstone theme into a theme
# modify partials
  # use old site header
  # include files in header
# modify layouts
# add content
# config file
