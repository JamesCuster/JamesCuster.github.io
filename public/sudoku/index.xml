      <description>This is long term pet project of mine. The ultimate goal of the project is to create an R Shiny app which will take an user provided image of a sudoku puzzle, read the data from the image, solve the puzzle, and return the results. The project will be broken into its major component parts. In general, the purpose of the project is to showcase some of my practical R experience, as well as to learn how to do several new things with R along the way.</description>
